<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This project is created as a [team](#authours) collaborative practice, a reference for the others and a part of homework check process. It's a small project from scratch using plain JS, CSS & HTML and a primary purpose of learning how to:
* communicate as a team
* come up with one new feature for each team member to develop as an addition to original tutorial
* practice our project planning skills by breaking the project into user stories, organising the code into files&folders, prepare the wireframe
* collaborate with branches and resolve merge conflicts
* make us familiar with the project management practices by creating milestones, issues, pull requests, and using the project board for task and project progress tracking
* upgrage our coding skills
* finilise and document the project

A list of commonly used resources that we find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
